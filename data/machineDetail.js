  "Hay balers are a specialised piece of farm machinery which are used to compress harvested crops into bales for easy storage and transport. Mechanical hay balers are exponentially faster at collecting and compacting hay, and have revolutionised the productive capacity of modern farming operations. Different types of balers are commonly used, each producing a different type of bale â€“ rectangular or cylindrical, of various sizes, bound with twine, strapping, netting, or wire.",
